    *Self Join

--Inner Join

--select columns to output and include table names
--in the from, list the relevant tables separated by INNER JOIN
--Use ON to define the column to join on
-- other SQL clauses can be added

SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name 
FROM employees INNER JOIN departments

FROM employees INNER JOIN departments

--to improve the readability use alias after the FROM clause
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name 
FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id

--SET Operators
Union       -   All rows with no duplicates
Union All   -   All rows with duplicates
Intersect   -   Rows outputted by both the queries
Minus       -   Distinct rows in 1st query that are not in the 2nd


--Query Processing Order
5 -     SELECT BillingCountry, AVG(Total) > 100 As average
1 -     FROM invoice
2 -     WHERE BillingCountry <> 'Paris'
3 -     GROUP BY BillingCountry
4 -     HAVING AVG(Total) > 100
6 -     ORDER BY average DESC


Query order of execution 
1. FROM and JOIN s: determine which data is being queried  
2. WHERE : filter individual rows 
3. GROUP BY : group rows  
4. HAVING : filter groups  
5. SELECT : select columns and apply functions on columns 
6. DISTINCT : remove duplicates  
7. UNION , UNION ALL , INTERSECT , MINUS : apply set operators 
8. ORDER BY : order rows
